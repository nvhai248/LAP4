## Team reflection

**Does your journey to the deadline have any bugs? How have you overcome it?**

During our Streaming Data Processing with Spark project, we faced a when try streaming data with kafka. We try streaming data but result is null. 



**What have you learned after this process?**



## Stream tweets to Apache Spark

## Perform sentiment analysis on tweets

## Visualize the analytic results
